// The Container Problem
// Suppose you own a ship.
// This ship can carry up to 10.000 Kg in terms of weight.
// A merchant wants you to carry his goods with your ship.
// He has 500 containers and he wants you to carry as many as
// possible. All containers have an identifying number from 1
// to 500.
// The first 100 containers weight 10Kg each.
// The containers with number from 101 up to 200 (included)
// weight 20kg each.
// The containers with number from 201 up to 250 (included)
// weight 50kg each.
// The containers with number from 251 up to 300 (included)
// weight 100kg each.
// The containers with number from 301 up to 400 (included)
// weight 200kg each.
// The rest weight 500 Kg each.
// Put as many containers as possible without sinking your
// ship. Find a way to stop adding weight if you surpass the
// limit your ship can afford.
// Print to the console exact how many containers you have
// included to your ship and how much is the difference
// between the total weight of the containers and the weight
// your ship can afford (free available weight).
