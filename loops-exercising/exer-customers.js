// The clothing sales problem

//Imagine that you work in sales at a clothing shop and you are responsible for selling 3 products:

//A t-shirt that costs 10$
// A pair of Jeans that costs 30$
//and a Jacket that costs 150$


//You have noticed a paradox pattern. Every three customers, the new customer buys the same things.

//For example the first customer buys 3 t-shirts.
//The second customer buys 2 Jeans.
//The third customer buys a jacket.
//And then again the same from the beginning.

//The fourth customer buys again 3 t-shirts.The fifth customer buys again 2 jeans.The sixth customer buys again one jacket.

//That continues until the end of the day.

//Find out how much money your cashier has if the initial cashier was already at 150$ 
//and the total number of customers at the end of the day was 78.
