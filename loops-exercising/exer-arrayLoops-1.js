// Create an array filled with your friends' and family's names.
// Loop over the array and greet each friend e.g. Hello Maria! Hello Mike! etc.

// **Bonus**: Print the indexes of each item in the array.
// Expected output example: Mike is at index 1 of my friends array.



// Grades
// Write a program to calculate the average marks of the following students.
// Then, this average is used to determine the corresponding grade for the class.

// John    90
// Tom 60
// Jane    77
// Maria   81
// Carl    65

// The marks are graded as follows :
// Range   Grade
// <60  F
// <70  D
// <80  C
// <90  B
// <100 A





// ANOTHER EXER.

// Create an array of 6 number. Print the following result:
// Multiply the first with the second number and its result with the next number, and so on.



// Use a nested for loop to show the tables for every multiplier from 1 to 10 (100 results total).



// The Car Race
// There is a track with a length of 50,8km.
// To finish the race, everybody has to go for 8 rounds.
// 5 drivers are participating.
// Each driver is going with differents speed.
// 1. car starts with 81km/h and is gaining each round 12km/h
// 2. car starts with 69km/h and is gaining each round 17km/h
// 3. car starts with 85km/h and is gaining each round 9km/h
// 4. car starts with 80km/h and is gaining each round 13km/h
// 5. car starts with 75km/h and is gaining each round 16km/h

// Who will finish first?
